# Changelog

## 1.1.5 — 2026-08-25

- Rebuilds an orphaned Chrome offscreen translation page when its runtime port has disappeared.
- Retries one idempotent translation request after rebuilding the browser translation surface.
- Falls back to basic Chrome local translation when the optional online dictionary is unavailable.
- Replaces the misleading language-pack-only waiting message with an accurate multi-stage status.

## 1.1.4 — 2026-08-24

- Keep repeated manual word translations deterministic by caching a completed dictionary lookup in each translation worker.
- Retry transient dictionary connections three times inside one user action; persistent failures now report an error instead of silently returning a different partial result.
- Prevent Bridge health-check exceptions from escaping WPF event handlers and terminating the Windows application.
- Add a final dispatcher exception guard and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Translator\\logs\\desktop.log` diagnostics.

## 1.1.3 — 2026-08-21

- Normalize IPA combining tie bars so affricates render as familiar learner-dictionary forms such as `crouch /kraʊtʃ/` and `judge /dʒʌdʒ/` instead of displaying detached arcs.

## 1.1.2 — 2026-08-21

- Fixed a word-lookup race where the first OCR translation could omit phonetics and dictionary senses until Translate Chinese was clicked twice.
- Retry one transient dictionary connection failure before falling back to basic local translation.
- Keep a valid original dictionary entry instead of replacing words such as `during` with an unrelated guessed lemma.
- Prefer explicitly tagged US pronunciation data and normalize IPA for a consistent learner-facing display (`/praʊd/`, `/ˈdjʊərɪŋ/`).

## 1.1.1 — 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- normalized syllabic-consonant IPA so `consultation` renders as `/ˌkɒnsəlˈteɪʃən/` without missing glyphs;
- rejected corrupted dictionary phonetics and preserved UTF-8 IPA through the native bridge;
- serialized Chrome Translator work and recreated failed sessions so one word cannot poison later translations;
- routed Windows translations through a working visible side-panel session before the offscreen fallback;
- corrected the local-language-pack recovery instruction;
- made per-user installation robust when the Windows shell-folder API is unavailable;
- prevented Chrome from restarting Bridge Host during an in-place upgrade and locking runtime files.

### Verified

- 46 extension tests, release manifest verification, and 11 Windows technical checks;
- self-contained x64 publish, installer compilation, real install, locked-host in-place upgrade, startup, registry, and favorites-preservation checks.
